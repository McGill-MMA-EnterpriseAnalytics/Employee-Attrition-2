# Model Monitoring and Retraining Strategy

This document describes the high-level monitoring and retraining strategy for the Employee Attrition model. For detailed drift detection implementation, please refer to [drift_detection_guide.md](drift_detection_guide.md).

## Overview

The monitoring system consists of several components:
1. Drift detection for features and predictions
2. Performance metric tracking
3. Automated retraining triggers
4. Alert generation
5. MLflow integration

## Monitoring Strategy

### 1. Production Automation Pipeline

The complete production workflow runs automatically via GitHub Actions:
- Schedule: Monthly on the 1st at 2:00 AM UTC
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/production_automation.yml`
- Components:
  - Data loading and validation
  - Drift detection
  - Model retraining (if needed)
  - Performance evaluation
  - Alert generation

### 2. Monitoring Components

The system monitors:
- Feature distributions
- Prediction distributions
- Model performance metrics
- Operational metrics
- Data quality indicators

### 3. Alert System

Alerts are generated for:
- Significant feature drift
- Prediction drift
- Performance degradation
- Training failures
- Data quality issues

## Model Governance

### Retraining Decision Process

1. **Automated Analysis**:
   - Drift detection runs monthly
   - Thresholds are checked automatically
   - Results logged to MLflow

2. **Review Requirements**:
   - Performance metrics comparison
   - Feature importance changes
   - Data quality checks
   - Model fairness metrics

3. **Approval Process**:
   - Create PR with "model-promotion" label
   - Required reviewers must approve
   - Performance comparison must be documented
   - Model cards must be updated

### Model Cards

Each model version should maintain an updated model card including:
- Training data timeframe
- Feature drift history
- Performance metrics over time
- Known limitations
- Approved use cases

### Monitoring Metrics

The following metrics are tracked:

1. **Data Quality**:
   - Missing value patterns
   - Feature distributions
   - Data volume

2. **Model Performance**:
   - Prediction drift
   - Feature importance stability
   - Performance metrics (AUC, precision, recall)

3. **Operational Metrics**:
   - Prediction latency
   - Data processing time
   - Error rates

## Retraining Strategy

### Retraining Triggers

Retraining is initiated when:
1. Significant drift is detected (see drift_detection_guide.md for technical details)
2. Performance drops below threshold
3. New ground truth data is available
4. Scheduled retraining period is reached

### Retraining Workflow

1. **Pre-retraining Checks**:
   - Verify data quality
   - Check resource availability
   - Validate dependencies

2. **Retraining Process**:
   - Feature engineering validation
   - Model training with new data
   - Performance evaluation
   - A/B testing if needed

3. **Post-retraining Tasks**:
   - Update model cards
   - Document changes
   - Update monitoring baselines
   - Update drift detection reference data

## MLflow Integration

### Metric Tracking

The following metrics are tracked in MLflow:
- Model performance metrics
- Data quality indicators
- Drift detection results
- Retraining triggers
- Operational metrics

### Artifact Management

MLflow stores:
- Model versions
- Training datasets
- Evaluation results
- Performance reports
- Model cards

### Experiment Tracking

Each retraining run tracks:
- Training parameters
- Feature importance
- Performance metrics
- Data splits
- Validation results
